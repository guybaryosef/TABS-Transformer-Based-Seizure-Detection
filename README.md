# TABS-Transformer-Based-Seizure-Detection

A project by Jonathan Pedoeem, Shifra Abittan, Samuel Keene, and myself.

Orignially our 'Senior Projects' project in the Cooper Union, this project also:
- Participated in the [Neureka 2020 contest](https://neureka-challenge.com/).
- Published a paper, called *TABS: Transformer Based Seizure Detection*, in IEEE SPMB 2020.
- Currently working on a book chapter...


The code in the repo can be freely used. 
It has been polished since we used it for the Neureka contest, so if something doesn't work feel free to holler.
